2. Installing Python
Steps:
i. Download the latest Python installer from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
ii. Run the installer and follow the on-screen prompts.
iii. Make sure to check the box to add Python to the PATH environment variable.
iv. Open a Command Prompt window and type 'python --version' to verify the installation.

Setting up a virtual environment:
To set up a virtual environment, you can use a package manager like pip to install the virtualenv package:
pip install virtualenv
Then, create a new virtual environment using the following command: 'virtualenv myenv'
This will create a new directory called myenv containing a Python environment. You can activate the environment using the following command: 'my-virtual-environment\Scripts\activate'.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics
Python program: print("Hello, World!");
 Explanation:
i. The `print` statement is used to display output on the console. Inside the parentheses, we specify the text or value we want to print. In this case, we're printing "Hello, World!".
ii. The double quotes (") are used to enclose the text we want to print.
iii. The semicolon (;) at the end of the statement is used to terminate the statement. In Python, every statement must end with a semicolon.

4. Data Types and Variables
Basic Data Types in Python:
i. Integers (int): Whole numbers, both positive and negative.
ii. Floating-point numbers (float): Decimal numbers.
iii. Strings (str): Sequences of Unicode characters.
iv. Lists (list): Ordered sequences of elements that can be of any data type.
v. Tuples (tuple): Immutable ordered sequences of elements.
vi. Dictionaries (dict): Key-value pairs where keys are unique and immutable.
vii. Booleans (bool): True or False values.
viii. NoneType (None): Represents the absence of a value.
Script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
int_var = 10
float_var = 3.14
string_var = "Hello world!"
list_var = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
tuple_var = (6, 7, 8, 9)
dict_var = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30}
bool_var = True
none_var = None

5. Control Structures
Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. The most common conditional statement is the if-else statement.
Example:
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Loops allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code. The most common loop in Python is the for loop.
Example:
names = ["John", "Mary", "Bob"]
for name in names:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

6. Functions in Python
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They are defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parentheses for arguments. The function body is indented and contains the code that will be executed when the function is called.

Usefulness of Functions
Modularity: They allow you to break down complex code into smaller, manageable chunks.
Reusability: You can reuse functions multiple times throughout your program.
Abstraction: Functions hide the implementation details, making your code more readable and maintainable.
Organization: Functions group related code, making it easier to navigate and debug your program.

Python Function for Summing Two Numbers
def sum_numbers(num1, num2):
    """
    Returns the sum of two numbers.

    Args:
        num1 (int): The first number.
        num2 (int): The second number.

    Returns:
        int: The sum of num1 and num2.
    """
    return num1 + num2
Example of Calling the Function:
# Call the function with two numbers
result = sum_numbers(5, 10)

# Print the result
print(result)  # Output: 15

7. Lists and Dictionaries
Lists vs Dictionaries in Python:
Lists:
Ordered collection of elements.
Elements can be of any data type.
Access elements using their index (0-based).
Mutable (elements can be modified).

Dictionaries:
Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Keys are unique and immutable.
Values can be of any data type.
Access values using the corresponding key.
Mutable (values can be modified).

Script Demonstrating Operations on Lists and Dictionaries:

# Create a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Create a dictionary with key-value pairs
names = {
    "John": "Doe",
    "Jane": "Smith",
    "Mark": "Johnson"
}

# List operations:
print("List:")
print("Original list:", numbers)
numbers.append(6)  # Append an element
numbers.insert(1, 10)  # Insert an element at a specific index
numbers.remove(2)  # Remove an element by value

# Dictionary operations:
print("\nDictionary:")
print("Original dictionary:", names)
names["Jane"] = "Brown"  # Update a value using the key
names.pop("Mark")  # Remove a key-value pair
names.update({"Bill": "Taylor"})  # Add a new key-value pair

# Print updated list and dictionary:
print("Updated list:", numbers)
print("Updated dictionary:", names)

Output:
List:
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Updated list: [1, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Dictionary:
Original dictionary: {'John': 'Doe', 'Jane': 'Smith', 'Mark': 'Johnson'}
Updated dictionary: {'John': 'Doe', 'Jane': 'Brown', 'Bill': 'Taylor'}

8. Exception handling
Exception handling in Python allows you to handle unexpected events that occur during program execution. It provides mechanisms to trap and handle errors, preventing the program from crashing and allowing you to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience.

Try: This block contains the code that may raise an exception. If an exception occurs within the 'try' block, control jumps to the corresponding 'except' block.
Except: This block handles the exception raised in the 'try' block. It specifies the type of exception to handle and provides a response to the exception.
Finally: This block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations or to ensure that certain actions are always executed.

Example:
# Import exception classes
from Exception import ValueError, IndexError

# Define a function that may raise exceptions
def get_element(list, index):
    try:
        return list[index]
    except IndexError:
        print("Index out of range!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input type!")
    finally:
        print("Function execution complete!")

# Call the function with valid and invalid input
get_element([1, 2, 3], 0)  # Prints: 1
get_element([1, 2, 3], -1)  # Prints: Index out of range!
get_element("abc", 0)  # Prints: Invalid input type!

9. Modules and Packages
Modules
Modules are individual Python files with a .py extension that contain functions, classes, and other code. They provide a way to organize and reuse code.
You can define your own modules or import modules from external libraries.
Packages Packages are directories that contain multiple modules. They are used to organize related modules into a hierarchical structure.
When you import a package, you import all the modules it contains.
Importing Modules
To import a module, use the 'import' statement:
import module_name
Using a Module
Once a module is imported, you can access its functions, classes, and variables using the dot notation:
module_name.function_name()
module_name.class_name()
module_name.variable_name

Example: Using the Math Module
The math module is a built-in Python module that provides mathematical functions. To use it:
import math
# Calculate the square root of 2
result = math.sqrt(2)
print(result)
Output: 1.4142135623730951

10. File I/O
Reading from Files

# Open the file in read mode
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as f:
    # Read the entire file content
    content = f.read()
    # Print the content to the console
    print(content)
Writing to Files

# Open the file in write mode
with open('filename.txt', 'w') as f:
    # Write the list of strings to the file
    for string in ['string1', 'string2', 'string3']:
        f.write(string + '\n')
